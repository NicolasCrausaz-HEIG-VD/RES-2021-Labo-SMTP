# RES - SMTP Pranks

> By Alec Berney & Nicolas Crausaz

## Introduction

This lab is part of the HEIG-VD's RES course. It consists in the implementation of a "mail prank sending" software.

The objectives of this lab are:
- To become familiar with the *SMTP protocol*, by working with _SMTP formatted_ messages to a server, without using SMTP libraries
- To use client-server testing tools, like *mock server*
- Create and send *forged emails*

## Functionalities

TODO: Explain what and how the app does its job....


## Implementation

Class Diagram

Example of intractions (client-server level)


## Dependencies


## Configure

In case you want to test the application without sending real emails, you can run the MockMock server (you will need to specify localhost as your SMTP server in config.properties):

`add Mock mock jar command`


## Start pranking
